# üí≥ Wallet Credit Scorer ‚Äì Zeru Finance

This project builds a **wallet-level credit scoring system** using DeFi transaction data from the Aave V2 protocol. Using Python and machine learning, we calculate behavior-based credit scores that can help assess a user's likelihood of default, even in decentralized finance ecosystems.

## üß† Problem Statement

> **Goal:** Predict and rank wallet addresses by their creditworthiness using behavioral indicators from DeFi transactions.  
> **Dataset:** On-chain JSON logs of lending, borrowing, collateral deposits, and repayments.

---

## üìà Features Used for Scoring

The following features were engineered for scoring each wallet:

- `avg_borrow_amount`: Average amount borrowed  
- `total_transactions`: Total number of transactions  
- `repayment_ratio`: Ratio of repaid amount to borrowed amount  
- `collateral_deposit_ratio`: Share of total deposits marked as collateral  
- `risk_adjusted_activity`: Composite score of borrowing and repaying behavior  
- `borrow_frequency`: Normalized count of borrow events  
- `borrow_to_collateral_ratio`: Volume-based ratio to detect over-leveraging

---

## üßÆ Scoring Formula (Simplified)

A weighted combination of normalized features:
Credit Score = f(repayment_ratio, collateral_ratio, borrow_frequency, ...)

The exact weights are designed to reward consistent repayments, responsible collateral usage, and sustainable borrowing.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orryverse79-hub/wallet-credit-scorer.git
cd wallet-credit-scorer
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the credit scoring script:

```bash
python wallet_credit_scorer.py
```

### 4. Optional: Visualize the score distribution:

```bash
python analysis.py
```



üìä Sample Visual Output

üîç Evaluation (Step 7)
The scoring system was evaluated based on:

Logical consistency of score drivers (repayment behavior, collateral usage)

Distribution of scores across wallets

Top/bottom wallet profile analysis

Fairness Considerations:

No bias from wallet ID or user metadata

Transparent formula with interpretable metrics

Future potential for XAI (explainable AI) integration
